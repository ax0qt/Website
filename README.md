<p> On my birthday, I went to Disneyland. I went with my mom, sister, niece, nephew, and boyfriend. The first park we went to was Disney California Adventure, and the first ride we went to was Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission: Breakout. On this ride, it was my mom’s first time, and she screamed a lot. This was one of the most memorable parts of the day because she accidentally grabbed the person beside her and held on tight to their thigh because of how frightened she was. My nephew wanted to go on the ride, but he decided against it as we were about to wait in line. After my niece, mom, boyfriend, and I got off the ride, we were sure he would not have liked it and most likely would have been freaked out. </p>

<p> Another honorable mention is when we went to eat. We wanted to try a new food place, so I suggested we go to San Fransokyo to see what they had there. There we found Cosina Cucamonga. They had some tacos, and I just asked for what I usually get, but I asked my mom, who was going to try the quesabirria, to let me have a taste. When the food came and I tried the quesabirria, it tasted heavenly. I was so upset I didn’t get that instead, all because I was scared I wouldn’t like it, but now I know what I am going to order next time.</p>
