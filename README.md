<p>On my birthday I went to Disneyland. I went with my mom, sister, niece, nephew and boyfriend. The first park we went to was Disney California Adventure and the first ride we went to was Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: BREAKOUT, on this ride it was my momâ€™s first time and she screamed a lot. This was one of the most memorable parts of the day because she accidentally grabbed the person beside her and held on to their thigh tight because of how frightened she was.  </p>
