<p>   On my birthday, I went to Disneyland. I went with my mom, sister, niece, nephew, and boyfriend. The first park we went to was Disney California Adventure, and the first ride we went to was Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission: Breakout. On this ride, it was my mom’s first time, and she screamed a lot. This was one of the most memorable parts of the day because she accidentally grabbed the person beside her and held on tight to their thigh because of how frightened she was. My nephew wanted to go on the ride, but he decided against it as we were about to wait in line. After my niece, mom, boyfriend, and I got off the ride, we were sure he would not have liked it and most likely would have been freaked out. </p>
<p>   Another honorable mention is when we went to eat. We wanted to try a new food place, so I suggested we go to San Fransokyo to see what they had there. There we found Cosina Cucamonga. They had some tacos, and I just asked for what I usually get, but I asked my mom, who was going to try the quesabirria, to let me have a taste. When the food came and I tried the quesabirria, it tasted heavenly. I was so upset I didn’t get that instead, all because I was scared I wouldn’t like it, but now I know what I am going to order next time.</p>

<p>  When we switched over to Disneyland Park, we waited for the parade because it was just about to begin. Right when it started, I was so excited because I saw that one of the characters passing was going to be Miguel from Coco, which is one of my favorite Disney movies. Another part I loved during the parade was the Frozen parade float, which had the water horse as well as a forest scene from Frozen II. The whole parade was really cute, and seeing my nephew's reaction was adorable because it's his first memory of Disney; since the last time we went, he was too young to really remember.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we headed to Downtown Disney, and I was so thrilled because I finally got to choose a pair of ears to take home. I had my eye on a few ears and had to make a decision. I ended up choosing one that had a calavera in the middle to, in a way, also include a touch of cultural meaning behind my choice. The ears were beautiful and I was overjoyed to have them. I also decided to buy two pins one which was Hector from Coco and then a halloween pin of Minnie Mouse. </p>
